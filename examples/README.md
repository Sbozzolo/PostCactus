# Examples of working problems built with `kuibit`

In this directory, we collect working programs built with `kuibit`. You can use
these scripts as good examples of ``kuibit`` usage (or you can directly use
them).

> :warning: While `kuibit` is tested at each commit to ensure that nothing
>           breaks, these codes are not. If you find one that does not work,
>           please report it and we will fix that.
